# Intraoperative traction influence on patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs) after hip arthroscopy

## Hypothesis

1. Increased **surgical time** will be associated with **decreased likelihood** of achieving the minimal clinically important difference (**MCID**) and/or substantial clinical benefit (**SCB**) after **arthroscopic treatment** of femoroacetabular impingement (**FAI**)
2. Increased **traction time** will be associated with **decreased likelihood** of achieving the **MCID** and/or **SCB** after **arthroscopic treatment** of **FAI**

## Background

- Hip arthroscopy is a viable and successful option in Mx of non-arthritic hip disease
- Hip arthroscopy is demanding (constant traction) and has a high learning curve (requires a large case and regular case load)
- Previous **inverse correlation** between **surgical volume vs. surgical duration + complication rates**
- Little research on hip arthroscopy duration + traction vs PROMs

## Aims

Patient review postoperatively at:

- 6 months
- 12 months
- 24 months

Using four PROMs:

1. modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS)
2. Hip-Outcome Score - Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL)
3. Hip Outcome Score - Sports Specific (HOS-SS)
4. international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33)

### Primary

Illustrate effect of surgical duration on achievement of threshold scores such as MCID ± SCB after arthroscopic treatment of FAI (cam decompression and labral repair)

### Secondary

Effect of traction duration on achievement rates of threshold scores.

> Multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, baseline PROMs scores and pre-operative diagnosis to determine if surgical duration ± traction duration can be considered independent risk factors (RFs) for achieving, or failure to achieve, threshold scores on PROMs after hip arthroscopy

### Inclusion Criteria

- Ages 18-80
- Primary arthroscopic hip surgery performed at HSS
- Minimum of pre-operative completed questionnaire
- Primary hip arthroscopy consisted of cam decompression and labral repair

### Exclusion Criteria

- Prior history of ipsilateral hip surgery
- Pre-existing congenital hip condition
- High grade osteoarthritis (defined as Tonnis grade > 2)

## Reference values

Prior literature has shown utilization of the following reference values at both 6 and 24 months time points after hip arthroscopy

References values for MCID:

- mHHS = 8.2
- HOS-ADL = 8.3
- HOS-SS = 14.5
- iHOT-33 = 12.1

SCB values will be reported as an absolute score (instead of a change score):

- mHHS = 82.5
- HOS-ADL = 93.3
- HOS-SS = 84.4
- iHOT-33 = 63.5
